# Terrain Assets (Starter)

This is a starter structure for hosting image assets for the Terrain Code™ Intake Lite.

## Folders
- `intake-lite/v1/interludes/<section>/` — place your WebP images here (use `@1x` and `@2x` naming).
- `intake-lite/v1/dashboard/` — place your final dashboard image and small SVG icons here.

## File naming
- Example: `foundations@1x.webp`, `foundations@2x.webp`
- Keep alt text descriptive in your HTML.

## Versioning
Keep the `v1` folder. When you update artwork, create a `v1.1` or `v2` folder and update URLs in your app.
